			<h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
			<section>
				<p>Vilda, Danielle is a Multimedia Artist currently in her second year of college at DLS-CSB (De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde) under the degree of AB-MMA (Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Arts).<br>
				Recurring elements in Vilda's work are her love for bright, warm, and happy colors alongside her attention to detail and lighting. Her works tend to employ warm pinks, yellows, and blues of different hues. Additionally, her Instagram posts have an affinity for bakery-based puns.<br>
				Vilda has participated in several different competitions and exhibitions and has presented a paper at the 15th DLSU Arts Congress (2022).<br>
				When she isn't hard at work with her academics or personal creations, she is spending time with her family, singing in choir at church, or playing with her beloved dogs.
